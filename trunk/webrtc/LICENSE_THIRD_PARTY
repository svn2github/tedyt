Subject: Re: sqrt routine
To: Kevin Ma <kma@google.com>
Hi Kevin,
Thanks for asking. Those routines are public domain (originally posted to 
comp.sys.arm a long time ago), so you can use them freely for any purpose.
Cheers,
Wilco

Subject: Fwd: sqrt routine
Hi Wilco,
I saw your sqrt routine from several web sites, including
http://www.finesse.demon.co.uk/steven/sqrt.html.
Just wonder if there's any copyright information with your Successive
approximation routines, or if I can freely use it for any purpose.
Thanks.
Kevin

//  scoped_ptr mimics a built-in pointer except that it guarantees deletion

//  an explicit reset(). scoped_ptr is a simple solution for simple needs;
//  use shared_ptr or std::auto_ptr if your needs are more complex.

//  scoped_ptr_malloc added in by Google.  When one of
//  these goes out of scope, instead of doing a delete or delete[], it
//  calls free().  scoped_ptr_malloc<char> is likely to see much more
//  use than any other specializations.

//  release() added in by Google. Use this to conditionally
//  transfer ownership of a heap-allocated object to the caller, usually on
//  method success.
