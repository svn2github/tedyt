=== RTCBot ===
RTCBot is a framework to write tests that need to spawn multiple webrtc
endpoints.

== Description ==
RTCBot is a framework that allows to write tests where logic runs on a single
host that controls multiple endpoints ("bots"). It allows creating complex
scenarios that would otherwise require non-trival signalling between multiple
parties.

The host runs in node.js, but the test code is run in an isolated context with
no access to node.js specifics other than the exposed api via a test variable.

Part of the exposed api (test.spawnBot) allows a test to spawn a bot and
access its exposed API. Details are in BotManager.js.

== How to run the test ==
 $ cd trunk/webrtc/tool/rtcbot
 $ npm install express browserify ws websocket-stream dnode
 $ node test.js

== Example on how to install nodejs ==
 $ cd /work/tools/
 $ git clone https://github.com/creationix/nvm.git
 $ export NVM_DIR=/work/tools/nvm; source $NVM_DIR/nvm.sh
 $ nvm install 0.10
 $ nvm use 0.10
