This test will pop up a browser with two tabs, and will run video from
one tab to the other tab, across the local network interface.

In order to run this test, you need to have:

- a WebRTC Chrome binary in
  $PROJECT_ROOT/../../chromium/src/out/Debug/chrome
- an installed lighttpd in your $PATH
- a built peerconnection_server (make peerconnection_server)

You need to run the script from the test/sanity_check directory.

The first time you run it, you will be asked to choose a search engine :-(
