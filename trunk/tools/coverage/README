This file describes the coverage tracking script and the coverage dashboard.

ABSTRACT:
The intention of this small tracking system is to track code coverage data
over time. Since code coverage is continuously recomputed on the build bots,
the track_coverage.py script is intended to run on the build bot as a cron job
and extract the data from there. The dashboard doesn't care how often this
script runs, but running each hour should be more than enough.

The track_coverage.py script communicates with the dashboard using plain GET
requests (that, and POST, are basically the only way to get data into a
appengine application such as the dashboard). The dashboard is intented to
run on the Google appengine.

HOW TO RUN LOCALLY:
Follow the following instructions:

The dashboard can be started on 127.0.0.1:8080 using the dev_appserver.py script 
as described in the above URL (and in the following 'hello world' page).
