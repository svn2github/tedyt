"""This script grabs and reports coverage information.

   It grabs coverage information from the latest Linux 32-bit build and
   pushes it to the coverage tracker, enabling us to track code coverage
   over time. This script is intended to run on the 32-bit Linux slave.

   This script requires an access.token file in the current directory, as
   generated by the request_oauth_permission.py script. It also expects a file
   customer.secret with a single line containing the customer secret. The
   customer secret is an OAuth concept and is received when one registers the
   application with the App Engine running the dashboard.

   The script assumes that all coverage data is stored under
   /home/<build bot user>/www.
